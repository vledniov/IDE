### Prerequisites:
  - IDEs: Command Line Interface (CLI)
  - Languages: bash, C/C++
  - Frameworks: 
  - Technologies: Version Control Systems

### Objectives: 
  - Understanding and using CLI (basic level) 
  - Administration of a remote linux machine using SSH
  - Ability to work with Version Control Systems (git || mercurial || svn)
  - Compile your C/C++/Java/Python programs through CLI using gcc/g++/javac/python compilers

### General Requirements:
  Laboratory work is considered as successfully passed after fulfilling the following steps:
  
  1. You must elaborate a Report which will contain your work-flow and your conclusions.
    - Laboratory work paper Dead Line is due to next laboratory, and the report most be sent to my email in an appropriate format (such as PDF format). 
    - Laboratory work paper must have at least: 2 pages
    - Laboratory work paper must have a conclusion of: 0.5 pages
  2. You must elaborate a prototype program, and show how it work during the classes
  3. You must pass the quiz 

  _Note:_
  
  _More details you'll provide in your report, less questions I'll give to you during presentation of your report._

  _If you don't understand some words in this document please google it._
  
  _If you don't understand google explanation then try to ask for a help from colleagues or friends._
  
  _If you still don't get something then ask me. Write an email to me or to other teacher. Ask stackoverflow. Do something (!) because you will encounter all these keywords during your professional carrier. This will help to differentiate you from an average "b√Ædlo-coder"._

### Technical Prerequisites:
  - connect to a server (you can use a virtual machine as a remote server)
  - install necessary compilers on server
  - install GIT on server

    - commit to different branches (at least 1 commit per branch)
  - for _Advanced Level_ (grade 9 || 10) you should be able to:
    - set a branch to track a remote origin on which you are able to push (ex. github, bitbucket or custom server)
    - reset a branch to previous commit
    - merge 2 branches
